        <p><strong>FreeBible</strong> was conceived from a dream to make the Bible readily available on any device, in multiple languages,
            with diverse commentaries, all while being completely offline, free, and free from ads. This dream stemmed from my
            desire to read the Bible on my Sailfish device and various other platforms, enabling easy sharing of thoughts and
            fostering a deeper understanding of God\'s profound teachings.</p>
