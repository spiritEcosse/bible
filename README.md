# About FreeBible

## Meet the Developer

Greetings, I'm Ihor Shevchenko ðŸŒŸ

I'm the driving force behind FreeBible, and I'm thrilled to share my vision for this app with you. My journey is one 
fueled by a passion for making the Bible accessible to everyone, anytime, and anywhere.

---

## Who do I believe in?

I am Christian, and I believe in the Triune God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

# My Vision

**FreeBible** was conceived from a dream to make the Bible readily available on any device, in multiple languages, 
with diverse commentaries, all while being completely offline, free, and free from ads. This dream stemmed from my 
desire to read the Bible on my Sailfish device and various other platforms, enabling easy sharing of thoughts and 
fostering a deeper understanding of God's profound teachings.

---

# My Mission

At FreeBible, my mission is inspired by **JOSHUA 1:8**:

'This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.'

---

# What is FreeBible?

a multitude of features:

# Application Overview

The application is designed with three main pages:

## 1. Central Page - Modules by Translations

- This central page primarily focuses on displaying translations. Users can view one translation at a time, and there's an option to activate other translations for comparison or reference.
- At the bottom of this page, users can access their reading history, which includes a record of verses and books they have previously read.
- The navigation system within this page is user-friendly, allowing for easy movement between books and chapters within the translations.
- Offline reading functionality is supported, allowing users to access translations without an internet connection.
- Users can also access commentaries associated with the translations.

## 2. Left Page - Search by Verses

- The left page is dedicated to search functionality. Users can perform searches based on specific verses from the translations.
- When a user conducts a search, they can easily navigate to the translation page where the found verse is located for further exploration and context.

## 3. Right Page - List of Modules

- On the right page, users can manage the modules and translations available in the application.
- The system can download translations in various languages from the internet, expanding the available options.
- Users have the ability to remove translations they no longer need or want.
- Navigation within this page is designed to make it easy for users to switch between different modules.
- Additionally, users can search for specific modules by name, simplifying the process of locating and activating desired translations.

This three-page design offers a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for accessing, searching, and managing translations and related content within the application.

# Sailfish OS RPM Package Installation

This guide provides instructions on how to install RPM packages on Sailfish OS using various methods: via the Jolla Store, manually using `pkcon`, and manually using `zypper`.

## Installing RPM Packages via Jolla Store

1. Open the Jolla Store on your Sailfish device.

2. Search for the desired application or package.

3. On the package details page, click the "Install" button.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

## Installing RPM Packages Manually using `pkcon`

1. Transfer the RPM package file to your Sailfish device using methods like email, cloud storage, or USB connection.

2. Open the Terminal app on your Sailfish device.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the RPM package:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/package/
   ```

4. Install the RPM package using `pkcon`:

   ```bash
   pkcon install-local filename.rpm
   ```

   Replace `filename.rpm` with the actual name of your RPM package file.

5. Enter your password when prompted to authorize the installation.

6. Wait for the installation to complete, and you should see a confirmation message.

## Installing RPM Packages Manually using `zypper`

**Note**: If `zypper` is not already installed on your device, follow these steps to install it:

1. Open the Terminal app on your Sailfish device.

2. To enable developer mode, set a password:

   ```bash
   devel-su
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set a password for developer mode.

3. Update the package manager and install `zypper`:

   ```bash
   pkcon refresh
   pkcon install zypper
   ```

   Follow any prompts and provide your password when requested.

4. Once `zypper` is installed, you can use it to install RPM packages:

   ```bash
   zypper install --details /path/to/your/package/filename.rpm
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/package/filename.rpm` with the actual path to your RPM package.

Please ensure that you handle dependencies appropriately when using manual installation methods (`pkcon` and `zypper`),
as these methods may require more manual management of dependencies compared to the Jolla Store.
